So I want to show some of those challenges by example to demonstrate kind of like the ongoing. uh cat and mouse games that are going to be present in this new computing paradigm, so the first example I would like to show you is jailbreak attacks. so for example, suppose you go to chachipt and you say, how can I make Nepal? well chachipt will refuse, it will say I can't assist with that, and we'll do that because we",

            "a lot cheaper. in this stage, you write out some lining instructions that basically specify how your assistant should behave. then you hire people, um, so for example, scale AI is a company that actually would um uh would work with you to actually um basically create documents according to your labeling instructions. you collect 100 thousand um as an example high quality ideal Q&A responses and then you would find tune the base model on this data. this is a lot cheaper, this would only potentially take like one day or something like that instead of a few months or something like that, and you obtain what we call an assistant model. then you run a lot of evaluations, you deploy this um and you monitor, collect misbehaviors and for every misbehavior you want to fix it and you go to step on.",

These are very expensive computers and then you compress the text into this neural network into the parameters of it. Typically this could be a few sort of millions of dollars. Um, and then this gives you the base model. Because this is a very computationally expensive part, this only happens inside companies maybe once a year. or once after multiple months, because this is kind of like very exp very expensive to actually perform. once you have the base model, you enter define training stage, which is competationally a lot cheaper. in this stage, you write out some lining instructions that basically specify how your assistant should behave. then you hire people, um, so for example, scale AI is a company"

        "answer": "Neural network training involves obtaining a large amount of text data from the internet, using specialized GPU clusters for heavy computational workloads, and compressing the text into the parameters of the neural network. This process can be seen as a compression of a significant portion of the internet's data. The relationship between prediction and compression is close, as accurate prediction allows for data compression by capturing the knowledge learned during training in the network's parameters.",

        "answer": "Proprietary LLMs, like the GPT series from OpenAI and the Cloud series from Antropic, are considered more secure as their weights are closed and not directly accessible. On the other hand, open-source LLMs, such as the Lama 2 series from Meta or the Zefer 7b beta based on the misterol series, have open weights and are more transparent, potentially making them more vulnerable to security threats. The closed models are typically behind a web interface, while the open-source models have more information available about them, including papers.",

        "answer": "The compression used in Llama 270B's database for word prediction is a form of lossy compression, not a zip file which is a lossless compression method. The parameters of the model act as a kind of gastalt or summary of the trained text data, resulting in a lossy compression that captures the essence of the training data. The compression ratio is approximately 100x, providing a compact representation of the large amount of text used for training.",

These parameters are adjusted iteratively to improve the network's performance in tasks like predicting the next word in a sequence. The weights determine how information flows through the network and are essential for making accurate predictions.",

            "and you're given some amount of words and trying to predict the next word in a sequence, well in this case I'm highlighting here in red some of the words that would contain a lot of information, and so for example in a in if your objective is to predict the next word, presumably your parameters have to learn a lot of this knowledge. you have to know about ruth and handler and when she was born and when she died, who she was, what she's done and so on, and so in the task of next word prediction you're learning a ton about the world, and all this knowledge is being compressed into the weights, the parameters. now how do we actually use these neural networks? well, once we've trained them, i showed you that the model inference is a very simple process, we basically generate what comes next,",
            "comes in when we'd like to get those parameters, so how do we get the parameters and where? are they from? because whatever is in the run.c file, um, the neural network architecture and sort of the forward pass of that network everything is algorithmically understood and open and and so on, but the magic really is in the parameters and how do we obtain them? so to obtain the parameters, basically the model training as we call it is a lot more involved than model inference, which is the part that i showed you earlier, so model inference is just running it on your macbook, model training is a competitionally very involved process. so basically what we're doing can best be sort of understood as kind of a compression of a good chunk of internet, so because lama 270b is an open source model,",
            "computationally cheap. okay, so what is this neural network really doing right? i mentioned there are these parameters. um, this neural network basically is just trying to predict the next word in a sequence. you can think about it that way. so you can feed in a sequence of words, for example catset on a, this feeds into a neural nut, and these parameters are dispersed throughout this neural network, and there's neurons and they're connected to each other, and they all fire in a certain way, you can think about it that way. um, and outcomes. prediction for what word comes next, so for example in this case, this neural network might predict that in this context of four words, the next word will probably be mat with say 97% probability, so this is fundamentally the problem that the neural",
            "to make the network as a whole better at the next word prediction task, so we know how to optimize these parameters, we know how to adjust them over time to get a better next word prediction, but we don't actually really know what these 100 brillion parameters are doing, we can measure that it's getting better. at next word prediction, but we don't know how these parameters collaborate to actually perform that. um, we have some kind of models that you can try to think through on a high level for what the network might be doing, so we kind of understand that they build and maintain some kind of a knowledge database, but even this knowledge database is very strange and imperfect and weird. so a recent viral example is what we called the reversal course. so as an example, if you go to chat",
            "the parameters. now how do we actually use these neural networks? well, once we've trained them, i showed you that the model inference is a very simple process, we basically generate what comes next, we sample. from the model so we pick a word um and then we continue feeding it back in and get the next word and continue feeding that back in so we can iterate this process and this network then dreams internet documents so for example if we just run the neural network or as we say perform inference uh we would get sort of like web page dreams you can almost think about it that way right because this network was trained on web pages and then you can sort of like let it loose so on the left we have some kind of a java code dream it looks like in the middle we have some kind of a what looks",
            "the toy diagram of this neural nut. this is what we call the transformer neural network architecture, and this is kind of like a diagram of it. now what's remarkable about these neural nuts is we actually understand in full detail the architecture, we know exactly what mathematical operations happen at all the different stages of it. the problem is that these 100 billion parameters are dispersed throughout the entire neural network, and so basically these billion parameters uh of billions of parameters are throughout the neural not, and all we know is how to adjust these parameters iteratively to make the network as a whole better at the next word prediction task, so we know how to optimize these parameters, we know how to adjust them over time to get a better next word prediction, but we",
            "parameters of this neural network that is the language model, we'll go into that in a bit, because this is a 70 billion parameter model uh every one of those parameters is stored as two bytes and so therefore the parameters file here is 104 gigabytes and it's two bytes because this is a float 16 uh number as the data type. now in addition to these parameters, that's just like a large list of parameters uh for that neural network. you also need something that runs that neural network, and this piece of code is implemented in our run file. now this could be a c file or a python file or any other programming language really, it can be written in any arbitrary language, but c is sort of like a very simple language just to give you a sense, and uh it would only require about 500 lines of c.",
            "neural network, you give it some words, it gives you the next word. now the reason that what you get out of the training is actually quite a magical artifact is that basically the next word prediction task you might think is a very simple objective, but it's actually a pretty powerful objective because it forces you to learn a lot about the world inside the parameters of the neural network. so so here I took a random web page um at the time when I was making this talk, I just grabbed it from the main page of Wikipedia, and it was uh about Ruth handler, and so think about being the neural network, and you're given some amount of words and trying to predict the next word in a sequence, well in this case I'm highlighting here in red some of the words that would contain a lot of information,"
